TeXRankO

To start, make sure you have installed the Matlab Compiler Runtime (version R2012a (Win 64 bit))

Installation: 
Create a folder (ie C:\TeXRankO), copy TeXRankO_pkg.exe to this folder and run it.  
The following will be created in the folder: 
Ranker.exe, TeXRankO.exe, readme.txt, readmeFirst.txt (this README file!)


First run:
To get things started up and create all the folder structure:
1) Use command line, cd to the created folder, run Ranker.exe without any arguments. 
2) You will get some error message (about not having enough input arguments blablabla...ignore.)
3) The following folders will be created in your directory: Data, LogFiles
4) DONE!

To analyse a new plate, use Ranker.exe
1) In command line, cd to created folder, run
    Ranker.exe Filepaths.txt PlateBarcodeID "BacgroundIM1.mat, BackgroundIM2.mat, ..."
      Filepaths = text file with absolute/relative file paths. Ensure that they are arranged according to:
        Col -> Row -> Subwell. ie A1a, A1b, A1c, B1a, B1b, B1c, ... H1c, A2a, A2b, ... H12a, H12b, H12c
      PlateBarcodeID = Name of the plate. This will be used in TeXRankO and all saved file name 
      "BackgroundIM1.mat, BackgroundIM2.mat ..." = File names of background images (in the same folder), as generated by GenerateBackgroundIM.exe
2) Log files will be created, named by the timestamp of the run in LogFiles\
3) A data file (Data\PlateBarcodeID.mat) and a thumbnail file (Data\BARCODE_thumb.jpg) for each plate analysed. 
4) DO NOT MOVE THESE FILES


Using TeXRankO
1) Run TeXRankE.exe
2) Choose an analysed plate either by giving the Barcode or selecting from the list at the bottom right corner. 
3) The following compares features in TeXRank and TeXRankO
    |Feature                    | TeXRank   | TeXRankO  |
    |a) Ranking                 | yes       | yes       |
    |b) Experiment information  | yes       | no        |
    |c) Scoring (in database)   | yes       | no        |
    |d) ECHO single shot        | yes       | yes       |
    |e) ECHO cocktail           | yes       | yes       |
    |f) Screen analysis         | yes       | yes*      |
    |g) Clear drop analysis     | yes       | yes       |
*Calculation on the fly - requires more time. 

TeXRankO currently supports 96, 192 and 288 images per plate (1, 2 or 3 subwells). 
If there are missing images, please use a blank image and insert them in the order accordingly.
REMEMBER to sort your images (in the text file used in Ranker.exe) by COL, ROW, SUBWELL. Indexing gets confused otherwise.
